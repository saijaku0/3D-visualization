**3D Graphics Learning Project**

This project serves as a personal learning journey into the world of 3D graphics programming. My primary goal is to track my progress and understand the fundamental concepts required to eventually build my own rudimentary 3D engine or a "parody" of one.

Currently, the project showcases a simple rotating triangle. This is just the very first step, a foundational stage in what I hope will be a much larger endeavor. Each day, I'm taking small but steady steps towards achieving my aspiration.

To streamline the development process and make it easy to build and run, I've implemented a package.json file. This allows for convenient project management using npm commands.

**Current Progress: The First Step**

Below is a GIF demonstrating the current state of the project – a simple rotating triangle. This represents the initial stage of my journey.
